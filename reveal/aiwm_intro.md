> Are you lost, not sure where to start let alone where to go?
Why ? Wieso ? Pourquoi ? 为什么?


Notes: Make it clear this is for those who think they need sensor fusion but not sure why, nor what it is let alone how to make it work
We will try in the next 20mn to answer those questions.
* Why would you need sensor fusion
* What is sensor fusion
* How can you get your first PoC and secure a path to production

## Why are we meeting today?

* To discuss AI / ML generally
* Share update about the AIWM
* Discuss next steps
